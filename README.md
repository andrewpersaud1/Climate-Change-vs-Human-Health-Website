# Climate change vs Human Health

CSC 474 Visualization

**Spring 2022**

An open-ended final project assigned to my group. Our topic happened to be on climate change vs human health. This topic was very broad and good enough for my group and I to analyze. Some of the topics that were discussed within this project were: 
- natural disasters by type
- climate change and temperature
- mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease
- underlying causes of death due to climate change

The purpose and goal of the project was to demonstrate our skills learned over the course of the semester by making a multicoordinate view. We could generate this multicoordinate view by using whatever language we wanted to use, the languages/software us
ed in this project were: 

1. Python
2. Vega-lite
3. jupiter notebook
